## Hello_CircuitPython

### Description & Code Snippets
Write a couple sentences here, describing this assignment, and make sure that you hit these two points:
* What was the goal of the assignment?
* How did you accomplish that goal?
  How you accomplished the goal is NOT a reflection, it is you telling the reader how to do this assignment, in broad strokes.

  Your description is the right place to draw the reader's attention to any important chunks of code. Here's how you make code look like code:

```python

```

**Lastly, please end this section with a link to your code or file.**  

### Evidence
Pictures / Gifs of your finished work should go here.  You need to communicate what your thing does.
For making a GIF, I recommend [ezgif.com](https://www.ezgif.com) Remember you can insert pictures using Markdown or HTML to insert an image.

### Wiring
Make an account with your Google ID at [tinkercad.com](https://www.tinkercad.com/learn/circuits), and use "TinkerCad Circuits to make a wiring diagram."  It's really easy!  
Then post an image here.   [here's a quick tutorial for all markdown code, like making links](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/)

### Reflection
Don't just tell the reader what went wrong or was challenging!  Describe how you figured it out, share the things that helped you succeed (tutorials, other people's repos, etc.), and then share what you learned from that experience.  **Your underlying goal for the reflection, is to concisely pass on the RIGHT knowledge that will help the reader recreate this assignment better or more easily.  Pass on your wisdom!**

### Wiring
[tinkercad.com](https://www.tinkercad.com/learn/circuits).  If you can't find the particular part you need, get creative, and just drop a note into the circuit diagram, explaining.
For example, I use an Arduino Uno to represent my Circuitpython device but write a note saying which board I'm actually using.

## CircuitPython Servo

### Description & Code Snippets
* Get a 180° micro servo to slowly sweep back and forth between 0 and 180°.   
* Spicy part: Now control the servo with 2 buttons. 
The servo only moves if you are pushing a button.

### Code
```python
while True:
    print(button.value)
    if button.value:  # Button is pressed (remember, we're assuming it's pull-down)
        print("btn1 pressed \t")
        print(current_angle)
        current_angle = current_angle + 10
        current_angle = max(0, min(360, current_angle))
        my_servo.angle = current_angle  # Set the new angle
    time.sleep(0.05)  # Small delay to avoid excessive checking

    print(button2.value)
    if button2.value:  # Button is pressed (remember, we're assuming it's pull-down)
        print("btn2 pressed \t")
        print(current_angle)
        current_angle = current_angle - 10
        current_angle = max(0, min(360, current_angle))
        my_servo.angle = current_angle  # Set the new angle
    time.sleep(0.05)  # Small delay to avoid excessive checking

```

### Reflection
This code was difficult until i understood that the distance sensor is just saying print the value that its picking up anyway. Then to set the colors on the neopixle from my old code to save myself a step. I then figured out that the code was simply saying if the distance is more or less then a certain value activate this color. And now when putting it all together and adding a few tweaks made it work.
## CircuitPython Distance Sensor 

### Description & Code Snippets
Use the HC-SR04 to measure the distance to an object and print that out to your serial monitor or LCD in cm.
Next, you will get the neopixel to turn red when your object is less than 5cm, and green when its 35cm.  Ignore the blue and 20cm for now, let's just keep it simple.
For your final version of this code, you'll smoothly shift the color of the onboard neopixel, corresponding to the distance, according to the graphic below.
(Neopixel should stay red when below 5cm and green when above 35cm)

#### code
```python
from rainbowio import colorwheel
import neopixel
import time
import board
import adafruit_hcsr04
sonar = adafruit_hcsr04.HCSR04(trigger_pin=board.D3, echo_pin=board.D2)


NUMPIXELS = 6  # Update this to match the number of LEDs.
BRIGHTNESS = 0.2  # A number between 0.0 and 1.0, where 0.0 is off, and 1.0 is max.
PIN = board.NEOPIXEL  # This is the default pin on the 5x5 NeoPixel Grid BFF.

RED = (255, 0, 0)
YELLOW = (255, 150, 0)
GREEN = (0, 255, 0)
CYAN = (0, 255, 255)
BLUE = (0, 0, 255)
PURPLE = (180, 0, 255)

pixels = neopixel.NeoPixel(PIN, NUMPIXELS, brightness=BRIGHTNESS, auto_write=False)

print("starting up...")
while True:
    try:
        print((sonar.distance,))
        cm = sonar.distance
        print(cm)
        if cm < 5:
            pixels.fill(RED) 
        elif cm > 35:
            pixels.fill(GREEN)
        else:
          pixels.fill(BLUE)
        pixels.show()
    except RuntimeError:
        print("Retrying!")
    time.sleep(0.1)    
```
